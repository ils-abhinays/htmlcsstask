                Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a 2016 American superhero film based on the DC Comics characters
                Batman and Superman. Co-produced by Atlas Entertainment and Cruel and Unusual Films, and distributed by
                Warner Bros. Pictures, it is a follow-up to Man of Steel (2013) and the second installment in the DC
                Extended Universe (DCEU).[7] The film was directed by Zack Snyder, written by Chris Terrio and David S.
                Goyer, and features an ensemble cast that includes Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Jesse
